Ultimately, I landed on this recipe about two years ago. It tastes just like fondue you'd eat on a cold night, at a warm restaurant tucked into a Swiss back alley. I've been making it ever since.\n\n**Ingredients (per person)**\n\n* 1 block gruyere\n* 1 tablespoon flour (this is the secret to a smooth fondue)\n* 1 clove garlic, minced\n* 0.5 cup white wine (dry, ideally Pinot Grigio)\n* 1 tablespoon brandy\n* 1/4 small lemon\n* 1/2 baguette (ideally one day old for a drier, firmer texture)\n* Black pepper\n* Ground nutmeg\n* Salt\n\n  \n**Directions**\n\n1. Shred the cheese and toss with flour so that the cheese won't clump while melting\n2. Cube bread into 1\" cubes, with crust on every cube\n3. Heat the fondue pot\\* to medium\n4. Add wine &amp; minced garlic to the fondue pot and cook for 2 minutes (You do want the wine to boil.)\n5. Reduce the fondue pot heat to medium-low (You do not want the cheese to boil. Try to continuously adjust the heat to be as warm as possible without simmering the fondue.)\n6. Slowly add cheese until thick and creamy (Be patient and trusting at first. The consistency will develop as you add cheese. You want to stop adding cheese at slightly thicker than the consistency you want the fondue to remain at. It will thin and smoothen slightly with the addition of lemon juice and brandy later on.)\n7. Squeeze in the lemon juice\n8. Add ground black pepper to taste (You can add quite a bit.)\n9. Add nutmeg to taste (Just a touch\u2014don't overdo this.)\n10. Add brandy\n11. Mix for 30 seconds\n12. Add salt to taste (Usually, no extra salt is needed at all, but make sure to taste for lack of salt in case you added too much acid \\[wine, lemon, brandy\\] or the Gruyere you used was too mild.)\n13. Eat!\n\n  \n*\\*You can use a saucepan instead of a fondue pot*", "It's not an oxymoron, but it is redundant.\n\nAn oxymoron would be two conflicting things.

While there is no guanciale in this dish, smoked shoyu adds a great meaty flavor.\n\nIf you don't have smoked shoyu, you can add a touch of liquid smoke to taste or simply replace it with a touch of soy sauce.\n\nPrep Time: 10 minutes\n\nCook Time: 45 minutes\n\nTotal Time: 55 minutes\n\nServings: 4 \n\nCalories: 629kcal\n\n### Equipment\n\n* Wide saut\u00e9 pan\n* Large pot\n* Whisk\n* Colander, if needed\n\n### Ingredients\n\n* 1 tablespoon butter\n* 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil\n* 2 yellow onions peeled and diced\n* 2 teaspoons sugar\n* 16 ounces spaghetti, rigatoni, or bucatini\n* 1\u20132 tablespoons smoked shoyu more to taste if desired\n* 4 egg yolks\n* 2 eggs\n* \u2153 cup freshly grated parmesan plus more for serving\n* Freshly grated black pepper\n* Salt\n\n### Instructions\n\n#### Caramelize the onions:\n\n* In a wide saut\u00e9 pan, heat the butter and extra virgin olive oil over medium heat until the butter is frothy and bubbly. Add the diced onion and cook, stirring regularly, until the onions deepen in color. Adjust the heat as necessary to prevent it from burning. About 15 minutes in, add the sugar and smoked shoyu and continue cooking the onions for an additional 15\u201320 minutes until fully caramelized and deep, golden brown. Season with salt. Turn off the heat.\n\n#### Cook the pasta:\n\n* Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook until 1\u20132 minutes under al dente. Scoop out 1\u00bd cups of pasta cooking water and drain the pasta. Note: depending on how you time it, you may be ready to cook the eggs right as the pasta finishes cooking, in which case, you can just use tongs to transfer the pasta straight from the water to the pot of caramelized onions. If you aren't ready, just drain the pasta first!\n\n#### Prepare the egg mixture:\n\n* In a large bowl, combine the egg yolks, eggs, parmesan, and ground black pepper to taste. Whisk for 3\u20135 minutes until smooth and creamy. Set aside.\n\n#### Temper the egg mixture and finish the carbonara:\n\n* Whisking constantly, pour half of the pasta cooking water into the bowl of eggs to temper the egg mixture.\n* Return the heat on the skillet of caramelized onions to medium-low. Add the cooked pasta and toss to coat with the onions.\n* Keeping the heat on low, slowly add the egg mixture, tossing regularly, until completely coated. Turn off the heat as soon as the sauce is coated, and the pasta is warmed through (about 1\u20132 minutes). If the sauce is quite thick, add more of the remaining pasta cooking water until the sauce reaches your desired consistency. It should be glossy and stick to the pasta! Taste and season with salt and more freshly ground pepper to taste.\n\n#### To serve:\n\n* Immediately serve the carbonara in shallow pasta bowls and garnish with more parmesan and black pepper.
