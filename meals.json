If there are any large chunks of fat, cut them off and discard them. Large pieces of fat will not be able to render out completely.\nUsing a sharp knife, score the fat in parallel lines, about 3/4-inch apart. Slice through the fat, not the beef. Repeat in the opposite direction to make a cross-hatch pattern.\nSalt the brisket well and let it sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.\n \n2 Sear the brisket: You'll need an oven-proof, thick-bottomed pot with a cover, or Dutch oven, that is just wide enough to hold the brisket roast with a little room for the onions.\nPat the brisket dry and place it, fatty side down, into the pot and place it on medium high heat. Cook for 5-8 minutes, lightly sizzling, until the fat side is nicely browned. (If the roast seems to be cooking too fast, turn the heat down to medium. You want a steady sizzle, not a raging sear.)\nTurn the brisket over and cook for a few minutes more to brown the other side.\n\n3 Saut\u00e9 the onions and garlic: When the brisket has browned, remove it from the pot and set aside. There should be a couple tablespoons of fat rendered in the pot, if not, add some olive oil.\nAdd the chopped onions and increase the heat to high. Sprinkle a little salt on the onions. Saut\u00e9, stirring often, until the onions are lightly browned, 5-8 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook 1-2 more minutes.\n \n4 Return brisket to pot, add herbs, stock, bring to simmer, cover, cook in oven: Preheat the oven to 300\u00b0F.

Bring the stock to a boil on the stovetop.\nCover the pot, place the pot in the 300\u00b0F oven and cook for 3 hours. Carefully flip the brisket every hour so it cooks evenly.\n \n5 Add carrots, continue to cook: After 3 hours, add the carrots. Cover the pot and cook for 1 hour more, or until the carrots are cooked through and the brisket is falling-apart tender.\n6 Remove brisket to cutting board, tent with foil: When the brisket is falling-apart tender, take the pot out of the oven and remove the brisket to a cutting board.

You can serve as is, or you can make a sauce with the drippings and some of the onions.

Season the veal shanks on all sides with salt and pepper. One at a time, roll the shanks around in the flour coat, and shake and pat the shank to remove any excuses flour. Discard the remaining flour.\nBrowning the shanks: put the oil and 1 tablespoon of the butter in a wide Dutch oven or heavy braising pot (6 to 7 quart) and heat over medium-high heat. When the butter has melted and the oil is shimmering, lower the shanks into the pot, flat side down; if the shanks won\u2019t fit without touching one another, do this in batches. Brown the shanks, turning once with tongs, until both flat sides are well caramelized, about 5 minutes per side. If the butter-oil mixture starts to burn, lower the heat just a bit. Transfer the shanks to a large platter or tray and set aside.\nThe aromatics: pour off and discard the fat from the pot. Wipe out any burnt bits with a damp paper towel, being careful not to remove any delicious little caramelized bits. Ad the remaining 2 tablespoons butter to the pot and melt it over medium heat. When the butter has stopped foaming, add the onion, carrot, celery, and fennel. Season with salt and pepper, stir, and cook the vegetables until they begin to soften but do not brown, about 6 minutes. Stir in the garlic, orange zest, marjoram, and bay leaf, and stew for another minute or two.\nThe braising liquid: add the wine, increase the heat to high, and bring to a boil. Boil, stirring occasionally, to reduce the wine by about half, 5 minutes. Add the stock and tomatoes, with their juice, and boil again to reduce the liquid to about 1 cup total, about 10 minutes.\nThe braise: Place the shanks in the pot so that they are sitting with the exposed bone facing up, and pour over any juices that accumulated as they sat. Cover with parchment paper, pressing down so the parchment nearly touches the veal and the edges hang over the sides of the pot by about an inch. Cover tightly with the lid, and slide into the lower part of the oven to braise at a gentle simmer. Check the pot after the first 15 minutes, and if the liquid is simmering too aggressively, lower the oven heat by 10 or 15 degrees. Continue braising, turning the shanks and spooning some pan juices over the top after the first 40 minutes, until the meat is completely tender and pulling away from the bone, about 2 hours.\nThe gremolata: While the shanks are braising, stir together the garlic, parsley, and lemon zest in a small bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside in a cool place (or the refrigerator, if your kitchen is very warm.)\nThe finish: When the veal is fork-tender and falling away from the bone, remove the lid and sprinkle over half of the gremolata. Return the veal to the oven, uncovered, for another 15 minutes to caramelize it some.\nUsing a slotted spatula or spoon, carefully lift the shanks from the braising liquid, doing your best to keep them intact. The shanks will be very tender and threatening to fall into pieces, and the marrow will be wobbly inside the bones, so this can be a bit tricky. But if they do break apart, don\u2019t worry, the flavor won\u2019t suffer at all. Arrange the shanks on a serving platter or other large plate, without stacking, and cover with foil to keep warm.\nFinishing the sauce: Set the braising pot on top of the stove and evaluate the sauce: if there is a visible layer of fat floating on the surface, use a large spoon to skim it off and discard it. Taste the sauce for concentration of flavor. If it tastes a bit weak or flat, bring it to a boil over high heat, and boil to reduce the volume and intensify the flavor for 5 to 10 minutes. Taste again for salt and pepper. If the sauce wants more zip, stir in a teaspoon or two of the remaining gremolata.\nPortioning the veal shanks: if the shanks are reasonably sized, serve one per person. If the shanks are gargantuan or you\u2019re dealing with modest appetites, pull apart the larger shanks, separating them at their natural seams, and serve smaller amounts. Be sure to give the marrow bones to whomever prizes them most.\nServing: Arrange the veal shanks on warm dinner plates accompanied by the risotto, if serving. Just before carrying the plates to the table, sprinkle on the remaining gremolata and then spoon over a generous amount of sauce \u2013 the contact with the hot liquid will aromatize the gremolata and perk up everyone\u2019s appetite with the whiff of garlic and lemon.", "ingredients": "4 meaty shanks Veal\n\u00bd cup Flour\n2 tablespoons  Olive Oil\n3 tablespoons Butter\n1 medium chopped into \u00bd-inch pieces Onion\n1 chopped into \u00bd-inch pieces Carrot\n1 chopped into \u00bd-inch pieces Celery\n1 bulb chopped into \u00bd-inch pieces Fennel\n3 cloves Garlic\n2 strips Orange Zest\n1 \u00bd teaspoons Marjoram\n1 Bay Leaf\n1 cup Dry White Wine\n\u00bd cup  Chicken Stock\n1 cup chopped with juice Tomatoes\n2 tablespoons chopped Parsley\n1 teaspoon minced Garlic\n1 teaspoon grated  Lemon Zest\n"}, {"instructions": "1 Preheat the oven to 230\u00b0C.\n\n2 Add the sugar and crumble the fresh yeast into warm water.\n\n3 Allow the mixture to stand for 10 \u2013 15 minutes in a warm place (we find a windowsill on a sunny day works best) until froth develops on the surface.\n\n4 Sift the flour and salt into a large mixing bowl, make a well in the middle and pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil.\n\n5 Lightly flour your hands, and slowly mix the ingredients together until they bind.\n\n6 Generously dust your surface with flour.\n\n7 Throw down the dough and begin kneading for 10 minutes until smooth, silky and soft.\n\n8 Place in a lightly oiled, non-stick baking tray (we use a round one, but any shape will do!)\n\n9 Spread the passata on top making sure you go to the edge.\n\n10 Evenly place the mozzarella (or other cheese) on top, season with the oregano and black pepper, then drizzle with a little olive oil.\n\n11 Cook in the oven for 10 \u2013 12 minutes until the cheese slightly colours.\n\n12 When ready, place the basil leaf on top and tuck in!", "ingredients": "150ml Water\n1 tsp  Sugar\n15g Yeast\n225g Plain Flour\n1 1/2 tsp  Salt\nDrizzle Olive Oil\n80g Passata\n70g Mozzarella\nPeeled and Sliced Oregano\nLeaves Basil\nPinch Black Pepper\n"}, {"instructions": "Heat oil in a deep fryer or deep heavy skillet to 365\u00b0F (185\u00b0C).\nWarm gravy in saucepan or microwave.\nPlace the fries into the hot oil, and cook until light brown, about 5 minutes.\nRemove to a paper towel lined plate to drain.\nPlace the fries on a serving platter, and sprinkle the cheese over them.\nLadle gravy over the fries and cheese, and serve immediately.", "ingredients": "Dash Vegetable Oil\n1 Can Beef Gravy\n5 thin cut Potatoes\n2 cups Cheese Curds\n"}, {"instructions": "Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/ gas 6 and butter 4 small (about 200ml) ramekins.
